## Data

This project uses publicly available datasets from official sources:

- **CARBOSOL** (European Soil Data Centre – PANGAEA)
- **AEMET** (Spanish Meteorological Agency – public API)

Due to size and practicality, raw datasets are not stored in this repository.
All data acquisition, preprocessing and feature engineering steps are fully
documented and reproducible using the notebooks and scripts provided.
