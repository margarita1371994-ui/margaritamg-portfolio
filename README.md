## Featured Project

### GrowSelf — Crop Recommendation System (TFM, EOI)

**End-to-end applied data science project**, focused on predicting the optimal crop type using **soil, climate and geospatial data**.

This project demonstrates my full technical workflow:  
from raw public data ingestion to feature engineering, modeling and evaluation.

**What you can see here (not just read):**
- Real data ingestion from **CARBOSOL (PANGAEA)** and **AEMET API**
- Robust feature engineering and target construction
- Advanced EDA and data quality analysis
- Imbalanced classification with **SMOTE**
- Tree-based ML models (**XGBoost**)
- Reproducible, well-structured notebooks

Project structure:

**Key characteristics**
- Target: `cultivo_grupo` (agricultural land use / crop type)
- Climate features: aggregated 2017 indicators
- Model: XGBoost + SMOTE
- Metric: F1-macro ≈ **0.69** (baseline academic project)

## Why this portfolio?

Most of my professional work has been developed in **private companies** and cannot be shared.  
This portfolio showcases **what I can do**, using public data and real-world constraints:

✔ Complex raw data  
✔ External APIs  
✔ Data quality issues  
✔ Imbalanced targets  
✔ Production-oriented thinking
