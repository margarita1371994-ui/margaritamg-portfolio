## About this repository

Most of my professional work has been developed in **private companies** and cannot be shared publicly.

This repository serves as a **technical portfolio**, showcasing:
- My end-to-end data science workflow
- How I approach real, messy, real-world data
- Modeling decisions under practical constraints
- Clean, reproducible and well-structured code

All projects use **public data**, but follow **industry-grade practices**.
